"About This Reference<br/>
This reference was made by copying and pasting from the XML Spec at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml and including all the errata at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata (upto E44, which is as far as they had gotten when I made this page)."

[XML 1.0 Second Edition Specification Errata](https://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata[])

There were quite a few errata after E44.
